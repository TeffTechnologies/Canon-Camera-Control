# Canon Camera Control (C3) PWA

## Overview

**Canon Camera Control** is a web app that lets you control your Canon R series camera from afar using the internet.  It's for photographers, videographers, and developers who want to use Canon R cameras in unique ways. It uses the camera's Wi-Fi and a separate server (which you'll need to set up) to provide camera control through a website.

**What it does:**

* **Control from a Distance:** Change camera settings from your web browser.
* **For Canon R Series:** Works with Canon R series cameras.
* **Web App:** Works like a regular app and can be installed on devices.
* **Uses Internet:** Uses standard internet requests to communicate.
* **Works Everywhere:** Works on any device with a web browser.
